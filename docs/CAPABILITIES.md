# Capability evidence and limitations

The full design in design/metronome-design.md remains the product target.
This is not a declaration that the preview completes that target. "Implemented"
below means source exists; installed-app behavior requires Windows/device
evidence separately.

| Family | Implemented source | Not yet delivered or established |
|---|---|---|
| Core time and rendering | Rational scheduling, explicit note unit, meters/groups, subdivisions/swing, accents, layered cycles, seeded probability, gaps, two ramp domains and synthesized PCM | Configurable lane phase-transition policies, sustained tones, physical-device timing/soak results |
| Play and transport | Native pulse instrument, tempo/meter controls, shared AudioGraph transport, pause/stop/mute, keyboard timing observations | Safe-boundary live edits; calibrated audible position; tap-in, free-running/no-bar mode and additional stop conditions. Current edits require Stop + Start |
| Studio | Lane/event controls, original built-ins and generators | Pickups, nested tuplets, metric modulation, comprehensive groove/microtiming, multiselect/clipboard and notation authoring |
| Train | Finite bar-authored programs, ramps and gaps | Nested/time-authored programs, live hold/repeat/skip, adaptive coaching, goals/journals/history, recorded takes |
| Stage | Large instrument/setlist presentation and song controls | Seamless transitions: Next stops/flushes/restarts. No separate conductor/compact window, pedal/global/media control |
| Library and files | Local projects/preferences/recovery, WAV and checked MIDI export | Stem/media/chart/PDF processing, pitch-preserving stretch, tempo-map import, CSV history and comprehensive exchange packages |
| Sound and integration | Synthesized clicks, per-lane gain/pan, output-only operation | Imported samples, voice/drone, multichannel routing, MIDI/microphone capture and calibration, live clocks/learn/Link/network sync |
| Accessibility/localization | Five-language source dictionaries, keyboard and automation handling, theme-aware controls | Musician translation review, Narrator/Contrast/enlarged-text/high-DPI installed-app acceptance |
| Distribution | CI/release/Store workflow definitions and reserved Store identity | Verified native startup/download pending; ARM64 hardware/install acceptance, first Store submission and certification not established |

No missing integration is advertised as functioning. In particular, arrival-time
keyboard analysis is not microphone calibration, MIDI file export is not live
MIDI clock, a static concept is not an app screenshot, and a development MSIX is
not a signed Store release.
