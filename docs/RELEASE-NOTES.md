# Resonant Pulse preview

Native WinUI 3/.NET 10 metronome and rhythm workstation under active development.

The metronome is the large, centered primary surface on Play, with the tempo
inside the cyan/magenta dial. Click the number to type an exact tempo; the -,
**TAP** and + buttons answer immediately (hold to repeat; Ctrl steps by ten).
The time signature is a sheet-music picker (2/4, 3/4, 4/4, 6/8 and more) with
**Custom...** for the full builder, and every written beat is an audible click,
so 8/8 gives eight. Beat strengths are a row of bars (tall, medium, short or a
rest) that you click to change. Practice, Project and Help are quiet entry
points; every panel has Cancel and Done side by side, and Done applies. The
window uses a modern custom title bar, and restoring your last session is silent.

A running metronome follows Play without stopping. Sound and beat strengths
switch at the next audio quantum; tempo, time signature, tempo unit,
subdivision, swing, groups and gap bars are spliced in at the next beat. The bar
carries on when the meter is unchanged and restarts at beat 1 when it changes,
and the tails of earlier clicks finish in their original sound. Count-in and
practice-timer changes apply at the next Start. When a project has a
Studio/Train program, tempo and meter follow that program and Play says so.
Ctrl+M remains available inside settings panels.

The practice timer is in Play's **Practice** panel. Set a duration in
seconds and choose Apply; zero disables it. Stop and Start to use a changed
duration. Count-in and pauses do not consume practice time, and a shorter finite
program ends first. The final five milliseconds fade out. This limits live
playback, not export length. Manual timing reports also respect the stop boundary.

Auto-stop also supports written beats and complete bars, excluding count-in.
Use Play's **Practice** panel; zero disables an individual
limit. The earliest seconds/beats/bars/program end wins. Mixed meters, tempo
ramps, repeats and silence follow the authored program rather than counting
audible click events.

instrument. See the repository's docs/DELIVERY.md for current capability evidence,
